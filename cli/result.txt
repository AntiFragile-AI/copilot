The given Terraform plan shows that Terraform will perform the following actions:

1. Create a Docker container named "tutorial" using the "docker_container" resource. The container will have various configuration options such as attach, bridge, command, container_logs, entrypoint, env, exit_code, hostname, image, init, ipc_mode, log_driver, logs, must_run, network_data, read_only, remove_volumes, restart, rm, runtime, security_opts, shm_size, start, stdin_open, stop_signal, stop_timeout, tty, wait, and wait_timeout. Additionally, the container will have a port mapping from external port 8000 to internal port 80 with protocol TCP.

2. Create a Docker image named "nginx" using the "docker_image" resource. The image will have various attributes such as id, image_id, keep_locally, and repo_digest.

The plan indicates that there are 2 resources to be added and no resources to be changed or destroyed. However, it is important to note that this plan was not saved using the "-out" option, so running "terraform apply" may not guarantee the exact same actions.
